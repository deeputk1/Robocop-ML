# Robocop-ML
This project integrates reinforcement learning algorithms such as A2C, PPO2, TRPO to the RCRS platform.
Directions for downloading, building, and launching the RoboCup Rescue Simulator (RCRS) with OpenAI Gym integrated (Linux). A toolset called OpenAI Gym is used to create and contrast algorithms for reinforcement learning.
1. Software Pre-Requisites
    Git
    OpenJDK Java 11.0.9
    Python 3.9
    Openai Gym
    Stable Baselines 2.3.2
    Tensorboard 2.16.2
2. Download project from Github
    git clone https://github.com/deeputk1/Robocop-ML.git
3. Create a ubuntu terminal and setup a python environment and install the necessary requirements from requirement.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. export protocol buffers using the below command
    export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
5. Navigate to the root directory called ROBOCOP-ML 
6. run jupyter notebook
7. Open the TestEnv.ipynb file that contains the reinforecement learning algorithm implementation.
8. Run the cells of the jupyter notebook
